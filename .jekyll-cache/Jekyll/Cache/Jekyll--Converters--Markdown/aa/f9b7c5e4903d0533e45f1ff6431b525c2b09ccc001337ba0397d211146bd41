<p>What is “new” in our enterprise might better be called renewal, <em>renovatio</em> in the twelfth-century sense. On the one hand, it is a desire to return to the medieval origins of philology, to its roots in a <em>manuscript</em> culture where, as Bernard Cerquiglini remarks, “medieval writing doe not produce variants; it is variance.”</p>

<p>(…) Auerbach’s conviction that philology grew out of specific Renaissance technological and intellectual movements: humanism, the Reformation, and the invention of the printing press. Humanism and the Reformation needed to collect and edit manuscripts from the ancient world to better articulate principles of moral philosophy and theology, while the printing press permitted fixing and dissemination of sources and the new principles predicated on them.</p>

<p>(…) Bédier’s insistence on a single manuscript ha the effect of putting that manuscript into a relationship with its printed edition analogous to that of a unique manuscript of a modern printed book. Indeed, the analogy of the modern holograph manucript is so real that Bédier even postulates a medieval poet, like Jean Renart, revising his work for a “second edition” on the occasion of copying a new manuscript for a patron.</p>

<p>(…) Surplus variation in the manuscript tradition cease to have critical interest because they simply reflect scribal errors. where no author can be postulated for a work, as with the majority of the early Old French epics, the place and function generate an unknown poet.</p>

<p>It is that manuscript culture that “new” philology sets out to explore in a postmodern return to the origins of medieval studies. If one considers only the dimensions of the medieval illuminated manuscript, it is evident that philological practices that have treated the manuscript from the perspective of text and language alone have seriously neglected the important supplements that were part and parcel of medieval text production: visual images and annotation of various forms (rubrics, “captions”, glosses, and interpolations).
The medieval folio was not raw material for text editors and art historians working separetely, It contained the work of different artists or artisans - poet, scribe, illuminator, rubricator, commentator - who projected collective social attitudes as well as interartistic rivalries onto the parchment. The manuscript folio contains different systems of representation: poetic or narrative text, the highly individual and distinctive scribal hand(s) that inscribe that text, illuminated images, colored rubrucations, and not infrequently glosses or commentaries in the margins or interpolated in the text.</p>

<p>The apparently straightforward act of copying manuscripts is not free from mimetic intervention, either. In the act of copying a text, the scribe supplants the original poet, often changing words or narrativa order, suppressing or shortening some sections, while interpolating new material in others. As with the visual interpolations, the scribal reworkings may be the result of changing aesthetic tastes in the period between the original text production and the copying. Even in such cases, however, the scribe’s “improvements” imply a sense of superior judgement or understanding vis-à-vis the original poet.</p>

<h2 id="p-8-1">p. 8</h2>

<p>Recalling that almost all manuscripts postdate the life of the author by decades or even centuries, one recognizes the manuscript matrix as a place of radical contingencies: of chronology. of anachronism, of conflicting subjects, of representation.</p>

<p>If we accept the multiple forms in which our artifacts have been transmitted, we may recognize that medieval culture did not simply live with diversity, it cultivated it. The “new” philology of the last decade or more reminds us that, as medievalists, we need to embrace the consequences of that diversity, not simply to live with it, but to situate it squarely within our metodology.</p>
