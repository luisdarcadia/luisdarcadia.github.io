<p>For pourposes of analysis every genre can thought of as having a set of primary or logically necessary elements which in combination distinguish that genre from every other genre.
For example, the primary elements of the propemptikon are in these terms someone departing, another person bidding him farewell, and a relationship of affection between the two, plus an appropriate setting.</p>

<p>[…] topoi are the smallest divisions of the material of any genre useful for analytic pourposes.</p>

<h2 id="p-6-2">p. 6</h2>

<p>The logical incompleteness and aparent internal inconsistencies of many ancient writings are a consequence of the non-individual character, that is, their membership of the genres in the sense defined.</p>

<h2 id="p-6-7">p. 6-7</h2>

<p>These writings assume in the reader a knowledge of the circumstances and content of the particular genre to which they belong, and they exploit this knowledge to allow logical connections and distinctions to remain implicit or be omitted altoghether.</p>

<p>In ages and civilizations where, as is the case today, writer and audience do not share a common body of logic and expectation such features of literary works may well be faults of composition. But in situations where, as in classical antiquity, writer and audience do have this common background, they can be part of a greater sophistication in the convaying of information.</p>

<p>Until the genre of a particular piece is known, many accessments of the motives, methos or merits of its author are bound to be subjective.</p>

<p>Once a correct assignment to a genre has been made, the generic formula, that is, the raw material available to the author before he began to compose can be invoked and the author’s own individual contribution to the piece can be isolated.</p>

<p>All genres originate in important recurrent life situations.</p>

<p>Originality in generic composition can be treated under four categories, which together cover the whole field: first, the novelty which consists in introducing into a generic pattern topoi and notions not hitherto associated with it; second, the individual writer’s own choice, combination and arrangement of standard topoi of a particular genre; third, his alterations and modifications of a single topoi; and fourth, the employment by a writer of the major generic sophistications which are potentially applicable to all genres.</p>
