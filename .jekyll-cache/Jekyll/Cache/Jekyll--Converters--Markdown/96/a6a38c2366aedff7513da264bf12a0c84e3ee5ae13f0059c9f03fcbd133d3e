<p>This question is wedded to the broader problem of genre, of which the <em>Epistle of Enoch</em> provides a case in point. Several labels, for example, could be and have been applied to the work as a whole. First, the designation “Epistle” itself derivesfrom the Chester Beatty-Michigan Papyrus (fourth cent.).
(…)
This designation can be explained by the text to <em>1 Enoch</em> 100:6 in the manuscript: the children of the earth will understand “these words of this epistle (…)” after the eschatological judgement. This designation is anachronistic and cannot be traced to the Second Temple period, though it preserves the work’s formal awareness of itself as a <em>written</em> tradition (…)</p>

<h2 id="p-362">p. 362</h2>

<p>(…) what we call <em>1 Enoch</em> consists of a web of traditions in which the work of at least  19 originally discrete literary outputs with perhaps the authorial involvement of as many hands have at various stages been brought together.</p>

<h2 id="p-364">p. 364</h2>

<p>Conventionally, the use of Enoch’s name has been considered in relation to the more general problem of “pseudepigraphy” as a practice adopted by many Jewish writers during the Second Templo period. To today’s readers the notion of a work composed by an anonymous writer under a “false” name of someone who was not the “real” writer can carry with it the conotation of “forgery”.</p>

<p>Now, this problem is nothing new, and scholars have offered plenty of reasons why writers in antiquity chose to write under the names of other more well known figures. Briefly summarized, the include the following: (a) to meet the demands of libraries (e.g., Alexandria) for works of well known figures; (b) to gain a hearing for views which, given the obscurity of a given writer, would otherwise go unnoticed; (c) to honour and express indebtedness to the ideas of a well known or influential figure; and (d) to combat views which, to the minds of such writers, were beingwrongly attributed to such a figure.</p>

<p>So, the choice of Enoch’s name was not simply a matter of singling out an ideal figure through which revelatory wisdom in the form of visionary communication is channeled to an audience of “scribe of truth,” “righteous man,” (12:4) and as the only human being to whom such recorded visions have given (19:4), were declaring something about themselves. They were presenting themselves as unique carriers of a perspective disclosed through their interpretation of how the sacred past interpenetrates with a present and future they believed to be sacred as well.</p>

<p>The earliest recoverable reason for writing in the name of Enoch, then, was not so much a matter of adopting pseudopigraphal discourse <em>per se</em>, that is, a form of writing that stood out as one among a number of options that could be taken up by a given writer. Instead, Enoch’s inaugural function, though taking shape in first person narrative, works itself out within and in relation to a storyline of primordial events and revelatory journeys that attempt to reveal selected, yet essential, details about cosmos and time. Not far undeneath the “I” of Enoch there lurked a third person storyline which narrated what was going on during the antediluvian period and, perhaps too, how Enoch fit within its framework. Once set in motion, however, the first person voice of Enoch could take on a life of its own; its continued use would no longer be a matter of recounting Enoch’s role as a knower of demonic evil, human wrongdoing, the victimization and destruction of the helpless, as well as the intermediary and eschatological outcome for all these parties. Other Enoich authors, who aspired to bring the patriarch’s voice to bear on new situations, had to explain, indeed justify, the addition of further revelation in his name.</p>

<p>Additional Enoich revelation was justified in at least five ways.</p>

<p>The writer may be Enochic, but he is a very different, independent “Enoch”. Not only, then, does he take the liberty to reframe traditions associated with Moses (Deuteronomy) and Solomon (Qohelet), he stakes out a place on Enochic ground in order tocontest what he thinks are abuses of the very same Enoch tradition.</p>

<h2 id="p-386-387">p. 386-387</h2>

<p>It has been argued by some, especially on the basis of the Greek version, that the writer of the passage is engaged in a defense of his own work as a pseudepigraphon.If this is so, the possible charge of writing under someone else’s name is met by reversing the accusation: those who write “in their own names” are the ones who perpetrate falsehood and corrupt the truth. It is not clear, however, that this reading reflects the sense of the text in its entirety. The emphasis in both versions on “my words” (…) suggests the the writer’s attack is predominantly concerned with those who, from his point in view, have subverted or misrepresented the Enoch tradition they have received. The writer, in using Enoch’s name, claims to be the authentic interpreter and transmitter of Enochic revelation, and show that he is aware of others who have deliberately taken it upon themselves to make improper use of it. While the polemic here may be directed against the construal of the figure of Enoch in works such as Ben Sira, <em>Jubilees</em>, or <em>Pseudo-Eupolemus</em>, the fictive character of the <em>Epistle of Enoch</em> momentarily gives way to an admission that the real author is not, in fact, Enoch himself.  If this admission is sufficiently plain, the the text assumes a reception of the work as written by a claimant to Enoch’s name who, in his <em>interpretation</em> and <em>transmission</em> of Enochic tradition, regards himself as divinily inspired.</p>

<p>(…) The above account of authorial activity in the <em>Epistle</em> has implications for understanding genre. Though a literary work, as “text”, can assume a life of its own beyond the circumstances that originally generated it, an apprehension of it <em>form</em> and <em>function</em> can be closely bound up with authorial self-understanding. The <em>Epistle</em> offers an excelent example of a work in which a writer, drawing on existing portraits of Enoch, presents his work as nothing less than profetic. In concert with the author’s self-preservation and use of sacred traditions, the formal building blocks used in the <em>Epistle</em> add up to more than a piece that discloses an otherwordly perspective on eschatology or offers sapiential instruction.</p>
