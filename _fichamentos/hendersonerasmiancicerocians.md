[...] Erasmus pays lip service to the classical definitions of the letter as a conversation between absent friends, but he actually describes letter-writing as an exercise in persuasion. Although some letters are "extraordinary," most fall under rhetorical categories - deliberative, demonstrative, judicial - and employ the topics of invention to argue a point.

The Quattrocento humanists were anxious to purify letter-writing of medieval barbarisms. Noting Cicero's simple formulas of greetin and farewell, they were especially critical of the elaborate etiquette of address their society had inherited from the medieval *ars dictaminis*. However, their treatment of the letter as a miniature oration was essentially dictaminal. The humanists who took seriously the classical definition of letter as a conversation between absent friends were avant-garde. It was only extremists who were willing to flout contemporary custom by trying to write truly Ciceronian letters.

Erasmus disagrees with those who contend that letter-writing does not require art. He argues that the ancients themselves employed rhetoric and that the rules for demonstrative, deliberative, and judicial orations should be applied to the genre. The letter cannot always be limited to a plain style because it sometimes treats great subjects.
