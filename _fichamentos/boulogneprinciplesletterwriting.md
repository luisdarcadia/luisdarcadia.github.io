## II What a written composition should be

A written composition is a setting-forth of some matter in writing, proceeding in a suitable order. Or, a written composition is a suitable and fitting treatment of some matter, adapted to the matter itself. Or a written composition is a suitable and fitting written statement about something, either memorized or declared by speech or in writing.

Now, some written compositions are metrical, others rhythmic, others prosaic.

## III The definition of a letter


An epistle or letter, then, is a suitable arrangement of words set forth to express the intended meaning of its sender. Or in other words, a letter is a discourse composed of coherent yet distinct parts signifying fully the sentiments of its sender.

## IV The parts of a letter

There are, in fact, five parts of a letter: the Salutation, the Securing of Good-will, the Narration, the Petition, and the Conclusion.

## V What the salutation is


The Salutation is an expression of greeting conveying a friendly sentiment not inconsistent with the social rank of the persons involved.

+

Now, every salutation is said to be either "prescribed," "subscribed," or "circumscribed."

+

Of course, among all people some are outstanding; others are inferior, and still others just in between. Now, people are said to be "outstanding' to whom no superiors are found, like the Pope or the Emperor.

+

If one man is writing to one or several or several to one or several, and the writing happens to be among equals, or from inferiors to superiors, the names of the recipients should be placed first, in the order of the salutation, in the dative or accusative case with their adjectives. The names of the senders, on the other hand, with their corresponding adjectives, should be placed last, in the nominative case.

 But if superiors are writing to inferiors, the names of the senders should be placed first so that their rank may be indicated by the sequence of the writing itself.

+

`fórmula de humildade é necessária ao se dirigir a um superior`

but when any bishop or duke or people of any city writes to the emperor, the following things or ones like them should be added in conjunction with the name of the ruler: "to the renowned, most excellent, most invincible, most eminent conqueror and always august emperor of the romans, c_, *n_,* archbishop of pisa, though unworthy, expresses his due obedience in christ," or something similar to the forms above.

+

when secular subordinates write a salutation to their lords, they should not under any circumstances say "veneration" or "allegiance," but should say instead "service," "compliance," "servitude," "loyalty" "subordination," and the like.

+

`saudação utilizando o nome do destinatário como ornato`

Furthermore it is a custom to take the material of the salutation from 
the name of the recipient in such a way that we urge him to greater 
good-will.
